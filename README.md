# code-quiz


## Description

A fun quiz I built which flips through questions on the same page. This is still a work in progress, but I am going to add a score page to show a high score from the quiz, the quiz will also be timed. 

- My motivation for this project was to practice using Javascript.
- I built this project because I believe that it will help build foundational skills that be diverse in different situations while building website.
- This problem solves an efficient way to make a quiz. 
- I learned how to use JavaScript and apply it to a real world situation.
